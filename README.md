# Machine Learning project: Reality Mining.

One of the most challenging areas for the application of machine learning algorithms is Reality
Mining [1], in particular the understanding of social dynamics from the analysis of data describing
social interactions (e.g., data about mobile communications, coworking interactions, information
exchange, computer use, etc.). Several recent projects have proposed experiments in which this type
of data is collected [2, 3, 1, 4, 5] and a number of approaches that analyze this data have been also
published [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the question of exploring new and creative applications of
machine learning in this domain is relevant.
In this project the students will use the Reality Mining Dataset http://realitycommons.
media.mit.edu/realitymining.html [1] which contains mobile data from 75 students or
faculty in the MIT Media Laboratory, and 25 incoming students at the MIT Sloan business school
adjacent to the Media Laboratory. The goal of the experiment was to explore the capabilities of the
smart phones to enable social scientists to investigate human interactions.
